Connect 4
======
[**Connect 4**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This project is developed in Python, utilizing PyGame3, specifically for CSE550: Software Engineering.
